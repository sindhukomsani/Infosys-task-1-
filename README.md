Stock Price Prediction using ML

This project predicts the closing price of a stock using historical data from ADANIPORTS.csv. The data was preprocessed, split into training and testing sets, and two algorithms were applied.

Algorithms Used:

LSTM: A deep learning model that learns patterns from past stock prices and predicts future values. It is effective for time series data.

Linear Regression: A simple machine learning model that finds the relationship between stock features and the closing price.

Results:

The LSTM model achieved high accuracy and closely followed the real closing price trends.

The Linear Regression model gave decent results but was less accurate compared to LSTM.

The trained models were saved in .h5 and .pkl formats for future use. This project helped me understand data preprocessing, model training, and prediction in a real-world stock market scenario.
